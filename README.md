# React App using React Router 

This small project uses React's `React Router` in order to quickly and seamlessly navigate through different pages. The `React Router` make React apps feel more like *apps* rather than slow, unreliable websites. 

### What does this app use? 
This app uses a Fortnite API, which can be found here: https://fortnite-api.com 

I gathered information about the current items in the Fortnite Battle Royale item shop through this API in order to create a sort of shop of my own (cause why not lol). 

I also, as the name implies and as I previously said, used the `React Router` from `React`, but more generally, I used `React` to build this app. 

### Get started with React! 
If you're wanting to learn more about React, I recommend checking out [Codecademy's interactive course](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjz6fO0ou_uAhUxTDABHc6IChsQFjAAegQIARAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2Flearn%2Freact-101&usg=AOvVaw1ayMaswl3vFO16pM7zyzcl). After you've taken that, go check out [Dev Ed's series on learning React](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDyQo7g0_nsVHmyZZpVJyFn5ojlboVEhE)! 

A helpful and quick way to start a new React app on your local machine is through the `create-react-app` package, their documentation for usage and deployment can be found here: https://create-react-app.dev/

I've also found [this documentation on deploying React apps to GitHub pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) very useful! 

If you would rather experiment online, you can do so with [this boilerplate on Repl.it](https://repl.it/@templates/Create-React-App) or my own [template on CodePen](https://codepen.io/MrMaster/pen/oNYWNjr)!
